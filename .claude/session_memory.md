## Current Session: 2025-07-15

### Current Task/Focus
- Code organization and DRY principle implementation
- Motif system cleanup and consolidation completed
- Element file structure optimization finished

### Modified Files
- `banner/motifs/_utils.py` - Removed duplicated functions, now contains only shared utilities
- `banner/motifs/squares.py` - Added apply_squares_outline function
- `banner/motifs/stars.py` - Added apply_stars_outline function  
- `banner/motifs/triangles.py` - Added apply_triangles_outline function
- `banner/motifs/hearts.py` - Added apply_hearts_outline function
- `banner/motifs/dots.py` - Added apply_circles function, renamed from circles pattern
- Removed files: `squares_outline.py`, `stars_outline.py`, `triangles_outline.py`, `hearts_outline.py`, `circles.py`

### Key Decisions Made
1. Eliminated code duplication in motifs directory
2. Consolidated outline variants into main shape files
3. Removed duplicated drawing functions from _utils.py
4. Verified other element directories (effects, shapes, textures) are properly structured
5. Maintained DRY principle while keeping individual element implementations

### Progress Status
- ✅ Motif _utils.py cleanup completed - removed duplicated drawing functions
- ✅ Outline motif files merged into main shape files
- ✅ Circles.py merged into dots.py (same ellipse drawing)
- ✅ Individual motif files now contain their own drawing functions
- ✅ Shared utilities properly separated in _utils.py files
- ✅ All motif rendering tested and working correctly
- ✅ Effects, shapes, textures directories verified as properly structured
- ✅ DRY principle implementation completed across all element directories

### Next Steps Planned
1. Continue with any remaining code organization tasks
2. Test system stability after changes
3. Consider checkpoint commit for current cleanup work
4. Monitor for any integration issues

### Blockers/Issues
- None currently - motif system cleanup completed successfully
- System stability maintained throughout refactoring

### Technical Context
- Working in Windows environment (C:\workspace\github-banner-maker)
- Git repository with main branch
- Python project using Pillow for image generation
- Modular element structure: banner/motifs/, banner/effects/, banner/shapes/, banner/textures/
- Each element directory has _utils.py for shared utilities and individual files for specific implementations

### Last Updated
2025-07-15 - Motif system cleanup and DRY implementation completed
